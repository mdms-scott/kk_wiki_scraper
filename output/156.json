      "introduction": "Good morning! It's the remodelled Taihou! Reinforced deck armour! Even higher defence! An increase in open-air planes to boost capacity just for you, admiral!",
      "library_intro": "I am aircraft carrier Taihou. State of the art carrier with reinforced armour all round, including the flight deck. My enclosed hangers and Hurricane Bow look good don't they? My armoured flight deck has also been redecorated. How does it look? Do you think it suits me?",
      "secretary1": "Admiral. Are you really that interested in my hurricane bow?",
      "secretary2": "Yes, the anti-air weaponry is also state-of-the-art. I'll take on however many that comes!",
      "secretary3": "Martyrs... something I do not like to say. As much as I'd like to avoid saying it, it is a war we're currently in.",
      "secretaryidle": "Admiral! Making me wait... I won't say anymore. Training and planning are important. Shall we sortie once we are properly ready?",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiral, aren't you tired? Really? Well, that's okay. But don’t overdo it… okay?",
      "wedding": "Admiral.. Did I meet your expectations? Well, that's great♪ But I've still got much more to go. Let's stay together and do our best!",
      "show_players_score": "Admiral, have you read the report?",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Taihou, heading out now! I wonder if everyone is doing fine in Tawi-Tawi?",
      "equipment1": "This is good equipment!",
      "equipment2": "This makes me content.",
      "equipment3": "A nice wind.",
      "expedition_selection": "A nice wind.",
      "resource_collection": "A nice wind.",
      "instant_repair": "A nice wind.",
      "development": "A nice wind.",
      "supply": "With proper supplies and training, they won't call us turkeys!",
      "docking_minor_damage": "Gotta make sure we don't get any fuel leaks.",
      "docking_moderate_damage": "Okay, time to take a long bath once in a while!",
      "docking_complete": "It seems the dock is clear.",
      "ship_construction": "Seems like a new ship has been added to our forces!",
      "return_from_sortie": "The fleet has returned to base. Good work!",
      "start_a_sortie": "First Mobile Squad Flagship, Taihou, heading out!",
      "battle_start": "Let's do this! 601st squadron, launch!",
      "air_battle": "These reinforced decks aren't just for show. Second assault squad, launch!",
      "attack": "First assault squad, all launch!",
      "night_battle": "All ships forward! Wipe the remaining forces out!",
      "mvp": "How's this, Admiral? This is my, and our mobile squadron's true power!",
      "minor_damaged1": "This level of damage would not faze me!",
      "minor_damaged2": "Hah! E-explosion?! My Tankers? Are they all right?!",
      "moderately_damaged": "Argh! M-my fuel! Gotta make sure it doesn't ignite!",
      "sunk": "No matter how thick the armour... you will sink when the time comes, huh... However, you saw me going wild, didn't you? Good... I'm... satisfied."

    "hourly": {
      "0000": "Midnight. I, Taihou shall be the one telling you the time today.",
      "0100": "0100. Hmm? You want to train together? Sure.",
      "0200": "0200. Even if I'm the newest and most advanced, I'll feel insecure if you keep looking at me like that!",
      "0300": "0300. Admiral, shouldn't you take some sleep? Eh, you'll be fine?",
      "0400": "040...0... Haa... Fuu... Ah, I- I'm not sleeping! Really!",
      "0500": "0500. It's morning. Shall we start with some running? Eh, Dailies?",
      "0600": "0600. Admiral, what would you like for breakfast? A Japanese meal from Mamiya?",
      "0700": "0700. Stamina training is the most basic of basics. Some press ups before breakfast would go well.",
      "0800": "0800. The breakfast was delicious! Now for some more muscle training!",
      "0900": "0900. Admiral, why are you looking so tired before we have even started combat? Are you okay?",
      "1000": "1000. Now, it's time to really start the fighting!",
      "1100": "1100. That feels nice! Admiral, are you still holding up?",
      "1200": "1200. It's noon. I wonder what sort of curry is served in this fleet.",
      "1300": "It's 1300. Eh?! It's my turn to make curry, as I'm the secretary this time?!",
      "1400": "1400. Sorry, this ended up really late... but here's some Taihou curry.",
      "1500": "1500. How was my curry? It was great...? Hurray!",
      "1600": "1600. Most accidents occur in the evening. Let's stay vigilant!",
      "1700": "It's 1700. Eh?! An explosion from far away...? That's scary... be careful of fires!",
      "1800": "1800. Um... my apologies... triggered explosions are the only thing I can't handle... enemies are fine.",
      "1900": "1900. Admiral, as you're here... I've calmed down. It's true.",
      "2000": "2000. That suisei? Yes, I would never forget it.",
      "2100": "2100. This late already? Time seems to fly by when I'm with you. It's amazing.",
      "2200": "2200. Admiral, you're done for the day, aren't you? How about some alcohol with the late night snack?",
      "2300": "2300. If you drink too much... Oh? Hehe... your sleeping face is adorable. D'ohoh."
