      "library_intro": "12th Kagerou-class destroyer, Isokaze. If it's about combat experience, I won't fall behind that Yukikaze. I've fought again and again, participated in decisive battles, and fought to the bitter end. Yamato, Musashi, Kongou, Taihou... their last moments have been etched into my eyes. This time... I will protect them.",
      "secretary1": "What is it?",
      "secretary2": "Commander... you should stop while I'm still laughing.",
      "secretary3": "So be it... Isokaze shall be your opponent. I won't show mercy even if the commander should stand before me.",
      "secretaryidle": "Commander...The 17th Destroyer Division, can sortie at any time... Hamakaze and I are ready... right Hamakaze?",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiral, have you been eating well? If you don't eat and an emergency occurs, you may not survive it. Even surviving is a splendid battle in itself. So, let's go to Mamiya to eat.",
      "wedding": "Commander, what? This important discussion. Is it about the 17th Destroyer Division's formation? What, it's not? Then is it something about that Hamakaze? It has nothing to do with Hamakaze... I see. Nn... That ring... to me... w-what... eh! U-um...",

      "minor_damaged1": "Tch... There's so much more left in me, don't underestimate me.",
      "minor_damaged2": "Pretty good... such a big difference in firepower. But, I won't lose.",
      "moderately_damaged": "Darn it. I cannot be stranded in this place. Move, move it!",
      "sunk": "I can no longer move... but I will not cause trouble for everyone else. I'm sorry Yukikaze... Would you do me one last favor?",

      "0000": "The date has changed. I, Isokaze, will be reporting the time for today. What? Are you dissatisfied with it?",
      "0100": "0100. It is night.",
      "0200": "0200. It's night. What? Is there any dissatisfaction?",
      "0300": "0300. Gah... Commander, you're making such a difficult expression. Do you have something you want to say?",
      "0400": "0400. It is almost morning. I think I understand what is it that the Commander's so dissatisfied about, but...",
      "0500": "0500. But, even if I, Isokaze, is entrusted with matters outside combat. I will give it my best shot.",
      "0600": "0600. It is morning. Well then, it's time to make breakfast. What's with that look?",
      "0700": "0700. It's all right, Hamakaze told me how to do it. Here, it's done. How is it?",
      "0800": "0800. Commander, what's wrong? You have a stomachache? That's no good, it'll hinder your commanding abilities.",
      "0900": "0900. Commander, did your stomachache go away? Aren't you lacking daily training?",
      "1000": "1000. Good, it is time for practice. The 17th Destroyer Division is ready to set sail anytime.",
      "1100": "1100. Leave the lunch to me as well. Tanikaze taught... Ah, why are you running away. Commander!",
      "1200": "1200. It's noon. Here are combat rations from Tanikaze. To have rice balls on the sea is something exceptional.",
      "1300": "1300. The rice balls were delicious, right? Even though Tanikaze might not like look like it, she's really adept at taking care of others.",
      "1400": "1400. Good, it is time for a real sortie. Let's dispatch our main fleet.",
      "1500": "1500. Afternoon snacks? No, no, I don't want it. I'll grow an excess bulge if I do.",
      "1600": "1600. Commander, let's strike the tough enemy fleet. Of course, we'll pick the line ahead formation. What, diamond formation you say? You don't understand. You don't understand!",
      "1700": "1700. Commander, the day is going to end soon. How time flies. Even in a single day.",
      "1800": "1800. Commander, the dinn-- Why are you running away? It's all right, Urakaze will be helping me.",
      "1900": "1900. I-it took quite sometime but dinner is ready. Commander, how is it?",
      "2000": "2000. That savory egg custard, too, is from Urakaze. Ah, that grilled fish is from me, Isokaze. Is it good?",
      "2100": "2100. Thank goodness for Urakaze... Cooking is hard.",
      "2200": "2200. So it's time. Good, it's time for night battle practice. 17th Destroyer Squadron, everyone gather all around!",
