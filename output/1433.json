      "introduction": "Good Morning. The Carrier Graf Zeppelin, dispatched. Admiral, I'll be counting on you today, too.",
      "library_intro": "First of the Graf Zeppelin-class Carriers, Graf Zeppelin. Capable of undertaking three-dimensional commerce raiding, I am a heavily-armed genuine carrier. It seems that the technology of the Japanese carrier, Akagi, was also referenced in my construction. A Japanese fleet, huh. I'm looking forward to it.",
      "secretary1": "Am I to depart? That would be good, yes?",
      "secretary2": "What is it - you seem to be concerned. The flight decks are continually being maintained by myself. There is no need to worry.",
      "secretary3": "What is the meaning of this? This is not the style of your fleet, is it? An explanation, if you'd please.",
      "secretaryidle": "Messerschmitt… that has a good airframe. The Focke-Wulf is a extremely strong fighter, too… Ja. This fleet's airframes also... A…Admiral is also quite good. N-No, it's nothing.",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiral? Is there something on your mind? I see. That's fine then... If you wish to consult on commerce raiding then... No, if there is anything at all, it's fine to talk to me about it first.",
      "wedding": "Admiral? What is it? Do you have something for I, Graf Zeppelin? Ach... this? For me? It's a beautiful thing. Are you sure? I... see.",
      "show_players_score": "Admiral? Ah, you want the information verified? Roger.",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, sortieing! Raise the anchor!",
      "equipment1": "Very well then. This is a fine plane.",
      "equipment2": "While the Focke-Wulf also has a fine airframe, this is... Danke.",
      "equipment3": "Yes indeed.",
      "expedition_selection": "Yes indeed.",
      "resource_collection": "Yes indeed.",
      "instant_repair": "Yes indeed.",
      "development": "Yes indeed.",
      "supply": "Resupply is vital. At any time, no? It's a help.",
      "docking_minor_damage": "I wish to wash my equipment and body for a bit. That is no problem, no?",
      "docking_moderate_damage": "Apologies. I have sustained heavy damage. Please let me enter the docks.",
      "ship_construction": "Hmpf. A new ship, is it? From this arsenal here, many ships have been born, haven't they. How lively.",
      "return_from_sortie": "Admiral, the fleet has returned... Yes. The operation is complete.",
      "start_a_sortie": "Excellent. You can leave this task force in my hands. Flagship, Graf Zeppelin, weighing anchor.",
      "battle_start": "We've spotted the enemy, have we? Wonderful. Attack squadron, begin launch! Rout them!",
      "air_battle": "Attack squadron, sortie! Forward!",
      "attack": "Launch all capable planes! Hahaha! How thrilling.",
      "night_battle": "Heheh... a night battle, is it? That's great. I will show you that I, Graf Zeppelin, am no ordinary carrier. Fleet, follow after me. Pursue!",
      "night_attack": "Let me show you I am no mere carrier.",
      "artillery_spotting": "Let me show you I am no mere carrier.",
      "night_special_attack_modifier_cutin_at_night_combat": "Let me show you I am no mere carrier.",
      "support_expedition_team_arrival": "Let me show you I am no mere carrier.",
      "mvp": "Deploying the Graf Zeppelin to a real battle... Was this not the natural result, Admiral?",
      "minor_damaged1": "Ughh! What! A direct hit!?",
      "minor_damaged2": "A hit? The flight deck? Prevent any explosions!",
      "moderately_damaged": "Tch! They got me. And yet, my cannons still function! If it's a night battle, then... Admiral!",
      "sunk": "I'm...sinking in a fleet battle... am I? Ha...Hahaha...! Isn't that wonderful! Just what is... this feeling... heheh...",
      "christmas_2015": "Admiral, so this fleet also celebrates Christmas. And this Stollen isn't half bad at all. It was baked by this country's submarine? Hmm... Not bad.",
      "end_of_year_2015": "December... I was launched on the exact month. How nostalgic... What? Spring Cleaning? Me...?",
      "setsubun_2016": "So this is what Eugen says of a cultural occasion called \"Setzbühn\". It is undeniably peculiar. Right, I'll give this a throw. Akagi, here I come! Brace yourself!"

      "0000": "Guten Abend. Admiral, I will be serving as your Secretary-ship today. Leave it... to me.",
      "0100": "0100. This is fine, correct? Leave it to me. There should be no issues.",
      "0200": "0200. Yes, perfect. Admiral. Admiral? Is there anything you wish me to do? I will do my best as the secretary-ship.",
      "0300": "0300. Right! You desire coffee? Leave it to me. Be ready to taste the greatest of coffees. I am quite confident when it comes to aroma and flavor of coffee.",
      "0400": "0400. How is it. This is what real German coffee is. Ah! First you should enjoy the aroma thoroughly, and after that... Whatever. Please, go ahead.",
      "0500": "0500. It's already morning, Admiral. Why don't you go ahead and take a shower. I will support you with the work here.",
      "0600": "Guten Morgen. 0600. What should we do about breakfast, Admiral? If you are fine with something simple, I will prepare something.",
      "0700": "0700. Admiral. I will leave the kaiser roll, cheese, ham and the hot coffee here. Please have some when you are free.",
      "0800": "0800. Well, let us get to work. Let's start today's fleet operations. What should we do? Start off by practicing with Akagi?",
      "0900": "0900. Akagi, Kaga... So that is this country's first-tier standard carriers. They do not have any catapults. They also do not seem to have any guns...",
      "1000": "1000. I see aircraft that resemble my Messerschmitt. Are those not carrier aircraft? I guess they are the air force. What, that is not so?",
      "1100": "1100. It is almost lunchtime. What would you want to do for lunch, Admiral? What? \"Mamiya\", you say? I have heard the rumors. Hmm...",
      "1200": "1200. Hmm? So this is \"Mamiya\". The menu... has variety. What do you recommend, Admiral? Curry, you say? Okay, I will take it.",
      "1300": "1300. The curry from lunch was quite a memorable dish. So the fleet here gets to have that every day, correct? I see. Hmm....",
      "1400": "140... Ah, Bismarck. You were here as well. My time here is still short. Please teach me about things. Ah... That... is okay for now.",
      "1500": "1500. This country's culture is unique. Admiral, I will keep it in mind to study it as much as my efforts permit. Just like that U-boot.",
      "1600": "1600. So is that \"Shoukaku\", and \"Zuikaku\". They are quite the sight. So that is the \"apex\" of this country's carriers... Hmph...",
      "1700": "1700. The sun is setting. The setting sun is beautiful in wherever sea you are at. What is wrong, Admiral. Is there something on my face?",
      "1800": "1800. Today's dinner is... Ah, I have been invited to a \"Standard Carrier Banquet\" or the like... Admiral, would you like to join me?",
      "1900": "1900. Ah, Akagi. My gratitude for inviting me to the dinner banquet. Danke. What is that? \"Nabe\" you say?",
      "2000": "2000. \"Nabe\"... Is this similar to a pot-au-feu? Why is everyone surrounding the nabe? Teach me, Taihou. How should I eat it?",
      "2100": "2100. That was a strange banquet. But... Yes, it was quite enjoyable. Admiral, this fleet... this place is a good place.",
      "2200": "2200. Admiral, the night grows deep. Let us start wrapping up today's work. Should I make some coffee?",
      "2300": "2300. Today was quite a day too. Let us work hard tomorrow too. Gute Nacht."
