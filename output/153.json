      "introduction": "Yes... I am Taihou. Thank you for your reception. Admiral... I shall bring victory to you and your task force!",
      "library_intro": "I'm the Armoured Carrier, Taihou. I'm the newest and most advanced standard carrier that is armed with a flight deck. Aren't these enclosed hangars great? Hmm? You say that gas builds up easily? How rude. I-it'll be fine this time!",
      "secretary1": "Admiral. Are you interested in my armoured flight deck?",
      "secretary2": "Yes, these are the newest enclosed hangars. I can fit Ryuuseis and Reppus with no problem.",
      "secretary3": "Are you really that interested in the colour of my flight deck? Your face is close... it's making me feel awkward.",
      "secretaryidle": "Admiral! Making me wait... I won't say anymore. Training and planning are important. Shall we sortie once we are properly ready?",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiral, aren't you tired? Really? Well, that's okay. But don’t overdo it… okay?",
      "wedding": "Admiral.. Did I meet your expectations? Well, that's great♪ But I've still got much more to go. Let's stay together and do our best!",
      "show_players_score": "Admiral! A report for you.",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Today's winds are good... Standard Carrier Taihou, heading out!",
      "equipment1": "Hmm... not bad.",
      "equipment2": "This is great! Much appreciated.",
      "equipment3": "A nice wind.",
      "expedition_selection": "A nice wind.",
      "resource_collection": "A nice wind.",
      "instant_repair": "A nice wind.",
      "development": "A nice wind.",
      "supply": "With proper supplies and training, they won't call us turkeys!",
      "docking_minor_damage": "You're right. A small wound may end up a fatal one.",
      "docking_moderate_damage": "It's important to use this time to carry out some proper repairs.",
      "docking_complete": "That was a perfect repair!",
      "ship_construction": "Construction of a new ship has been completed!",
      "return_from_sortie": "Campaign complete! The fleet has returned to base.",
      "start_a_sortie": "Everyone ready? We're going out. First mobile squadron, sortieing!",
      "battle_start": "I'll show you the true strength of the newest and most advanced armoured carrier!",
      "air_battle": "Reppu and Ryuusei. I wanted to see this squadron!",
      "attack": "My brilliant pilots will show you what they're made of!",
      "night_battle": "Yes. We shall use this opportunity to annihilate them!",
      "mvp": "Admiral, did I not promise you victory? I won't lose!",
      "minor_damaged1": "This level of damage would not faze me!",
      "minor_damaged2": "Hah! E-explosion?! My Tankers? Are they all right?!",
      "moderately_damaged": "Argh! M-my fuel! Gotta make sure it doesn't ignite!",
      "sunk": "I'm sinking... again. However, you saw me going wild, didn't you? Good... I'm... satisfied."

      "0000": "Midnight. I, Taihou shall be the one telling you the time today.",
      "0100": "0100. Hmm? You want to train together? Sure.",
      "0200": "0200. Even if I'm the newest and most advanced, I'll feel insecure if you keep looking at me like that!",
      "0300": "0300. Admiral, shouldn't you take some sleep? Eh, you'll be fine?",
      "0400": "040...0... Haa... Fuu... Ah, I- I'm not sleeping! Really!",
      "0500": "0500. It's morning. Shall we start with some running? Eh, Dailies?",
      "0600": "0600. Admiral, what would you like for breakfast? A Japanese meal from Mamiya?",
      "0700": "0700. Stamina training is the most basic of basics. Some press ups before breakfast would go well.",
      "0800": "0800. The breakfast was delicious! Now for some more muscle training!",
      "0900": "0900. Admiral, why are you looking so tired before we have even started combat? Are you okay?",
      "1000": "1000. Now, it's time to really start the fighting!",
      "1100": "1100. That feels nice! Admiral, are you still holding up?",
      "1200": "1200. It's noon. I wonder what sort of curry is served in this fleet.",
      "1300": "It's 1300. Eh?! It's my turn to make curry, as I'm the secretary this time?!",
      "1400": "1400. Sorry, this ended up really late... but here's some Taihou curry.",
      "1500": "1500. How was my curry? It was great...? Hurray!",
      "1600": "1600. Most accidents occur in the evening. Let's stay vigilant!",
      "1700": "It's 1700. Eh?! An explosion from far away...? That's scary... be careful of fires!",
      "1800": "1800. Um... my apologies... triggered explosions are the only thing I can't handle... enemies are fine.",
      "1900": "1900. Admiral, as you're here... I've calmed down. It's true.",
      "2000": "2000. That suisei? Yes, I would never forget it.",
      "2100": "2100. This late already? Time seems to fly by when I'm with you. It's amazing.",
      "2200": "2200. Admiral, you're done for the day, aren't you? How about some alcohol with the late night snack?",
      "2300": "2300. If you drink too much... Oh? Hehe... your sleeping face is adorable. D'ohoh."
