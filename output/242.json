      "introduction": "I'm the fourth battleship of the Vittorio Veneto-class, Roma. Nice to meet you. What? Please don't stare at me, okay?",
      "library_intro": "The Italian-made, state of the art warship. Fourth of the Vittorio Veneto class battleships, Roma. Yes, I was together with my elder sister at that time. The day those monsters were dropped. I won't forget that pain. I absolutely won't forget it.",
      "secretary1": "Buon giorno. Did you call for Roma?",
      "secretary2": "Admiral, do you have an order for Roma? Oh, then that's fine.",
      "secretary3": "What's that Admiral?　The way you touch the left area around my deck is unforgivable. Can I give you the counterattack?",
      "secretaryidle": "Damn that bomber... you better remember this! Ah, Admiral? What? I didn't say anything. None at all. Aren't you just hearing things? Come on, work first work first.",
      "secretarymarried": "What, admiral? You seems free. How about becoming my partner then? Ah, of course that's not what I meant. We're just talking a walk over there, a walk. Let's go.",
      "wedding": "What? Even though I look like this, I'm actually busy. What's that box? 'Try to open it'? I'll do it later then. Wha? In this place? But now is...",
      "show_players_score": "Confirming the information? Well that's important.",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Battleship Roma, sortieing. I'm going first, sister.",
      "equipment1": "Japanese improvement... Well that's good too, thanks.",
      "equipment2": "Grazie. With this... maybe I will become better with this.",
      "equipment3": "That's decent",
      "expedition_selection": "That's decent",
      "resource_collection": "That's decent",
      "instant_repair": "That's decent",
      "development": "That's decent",
      "supply": "Grazie. I'm gonna go again, you can count on me.",
      "docking_minor_damage": "I'm going to need a little repair. What? Don't stare at me.",
      "docking_moderate_damage": "　Um, for me to be at the dock... well that's fine... Tsk, I already said to not stare at me!",
      "ship_construction": "Admiral, looks like a new ship is ready to join the battle line.",
      "return_from_sortie": "The fleet has returned. What is it? Please, don't stare at me too much.",
      "start_a_sortie": "Roma of the Vittorio Veneto-class, starting! I'm serious, follow me!",
      "battle_start": "Enemy fleet sighted! Commencing artillery fire. Here we go... Open all the gunports!",
      "attack": "Commencing attack! Main artillery, fire!",
      "night_battle": "This is a night battle? Well that's fine, I'll give it a try. Roma, charging forward!",
      "night_attack": "Alright! We'll point our cannons directly to the enemy ships. Fire, Fire!",
      "artillery_spotting": "Alright! We'll point our cannons directly to the enemy ships. Fire, Fire!",

      "support_expedition_team_arrival": "Alright! We'll point our cannons directly to the enemy ships. Fire, Fire!",
      "mvp": "Ah!? It's me... Uhm... Is it me again? Well, whatever. I do feel happy though.",
      "minor_damaged1": "Tsk... that hurt.　I'll remember this.",
      "minor_damaged2": "Iya... t-that place is... that's not bad, I'll show you this time!",
      "moderately_damaged": "Direct hit!? Am I done for? W-Well, I'm still fine. I won't sink this time!",
      "sunk": "Wa...N-no way... I'm sinking, again? That's ridiculous... No... Nee-san...",
      "rainy_season_2015": "The rainy season... hmm, this is the rainy season. But with so much rain it is also less air raids, it isn't bad, is it?",
      "early_summer_2015": "Even though it has become considerably hot.... Summer is soon. Neesan, I want to buy a new swimsuit. Hmm",
      "midsummer_2015": "Nee-san? You're going with the admiral? Fine then, I'll tag along. I bought this swimsuit anyway.",
      "christmas_2015": "Merry Christmas, and... a Happy Holiday, Admiral. Still... you're overdoing it a bit, sis. Geez...",
      "end_of_year_2015": "End year's spring cleaning, huh? I guess it's required. My sister's room looks horrible. Maybe I should help her.",
      "new_year_2016": "Admiral, Happy New Year. Please take care of me, Roma and my sister this year.",
      "setsubun_2016": "Settsuboohn? No, that's not it. The proper pronounciation is \"Setsubunga\", is this it? No? Japanese language is difficult indeed."

      "0000": "The date has changed, Admiral. I, Roma, will be your secretary of the day. What? Do you object?",
      "0100": "01...0...0... I'm still not used to this style yet. I did it correctly, right? Right?",
      "0200": "02...0...0... Zero-Two... Zero... Zero... Yes, perfect. I got it down.",
      "0300": "03...0...0... It's already three o'clock... Are you not getting sleepy, Admiral?",
      "0400": "04...0...0... Isn't it already morning? As expected, keeping at it everyday seems bad for the skin.",
      "0500": "05...0...0... I'm going to wake everyone up, okay? Admiral... you are sleepy now?",
      "0600": "06...0...0... Well then, what should we do about breakfast? Is yesterday's bread fine with you?",
      "0700": "07...0...0... Admiral. You looked sleepy so I made some cappuccino. Do you need another?",
      "0800": "08...0...0... Well then, let's get to work. Let's send out the fleet. To the West? South?",
      "0900": "09...0...0... So that's the Japanese Fast Battleship Kirishima? Hmmm...",
      "1000": "10...0...0... Eh, with Kirishima? I see. I do feel like trying to go up against her at least once as well.",
      "1100": "11...0...0... It's already noon... Time flies. What do you want to do for lunch? Mamiya's, perhaps?",
      "1200": "12...0...0... Japanese lunch is pretty simple, isn't it? I wonder if it can last till nighttime.",
      "1300": "13...0...0... That dish called katsu curry surprise me a little. Is it a type of risotto? Unique, isn't it? It's powerful.",
      "1400": "14...0...0... Bismarck? Yes, I do know her, albeit only the name. She's famous, you know.",
      "1500": "15...0...0... Ah, Kirishima? What is it? Did you need me for something? Ah, my glasses?",
      "1600": "16...0...0... I got a little nervous. Kirishima... doesn't seem like a bad person, right?",
      "1700": "17...0...0... The sun is setting. I'm worn out today too. How about you, Admiral? Is that so?",
      "1800": "18...0...0... Admiral, what do you want to do for dinner? Eh, Kongou? Kirishima? What's happening?!",
      "1900": "19...0...0... What is the \"Fast Battleship Union?\" Wha- whaaa--?! Me too? Whaaa?!",
      "2000": "20...0...0... This white wine known as \"Nihonshu\"... is good! You drinking, Admiral?",
      "2100": "21... Phew... They finally went back. Do Japanese battleships not have any sense of shame?",
      "2200": "22...0...0... Ah, sis. It's fine, I'm doing the job properly. Don't worry.",
      "2300": "23...0...0... Eh? I reek of alcohol? I... it's the fault of Kirishima and the rest!"
