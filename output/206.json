      "0700": "0700. I'm sorry for the one-plate meal. Is the amount a little lacking?",

      "1400": "1400. Admiral, of course I don't mind the transport missions, but the cargo... err....",
      "1500": "1500. I see. But carrying such highly volatile cargo is somewhat... yes...",
      "1600": "1600. Admiral, I'm feeling nervous in this hour. As I thought, one should be more alert to the presence of submarines.",
      "1700": "1700. Phew... it's a relief once we get past this hour. I was a little nervous.",
      "1800": "1800. Admiral, it's time for dinner. What would you like? Er...",
