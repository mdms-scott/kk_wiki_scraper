      "introduction": "I'm Seaplane Tender Akitsushima! Make sure to remember me along with this Taitei-chan, alright!",
      "library_intro": "I'm the Seaplane Tender Akitsushima! That's right, I'm a Flying Boat Tender constructed for the sake of assisting Large-sized Flying Boat and refueling at sea, among other things! Eh? Is my \"makeup\" too heavy? You're rude, maybe! I'm not letting you have Type 2 Taitei-chan, kay!",
      "secretary1": "Did you call Akitsushima?",
      "secretary2": "This Type 2 Taitei-chan? I'm not letting you have her.",
      "secretary3": "Heeey! Admiral, I hope you will not touch places that had nothing to do with you so much, maybe! Taitei-chan can't sleep like this, right!",
      "secretaryidle": "This camouflage is flashy isn't it? Nah, that's not true, don't you agree, Taitei-chan? Don't you think so? Taitei-chan thinks so too, don't you? Ah, Admiral, is it time for our next mission?",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiral, why are you so lost in thought? Ah, are you tired? Times like these, the Akitsushima-style shoulder massage technique will be... Ufufu, hey, feels good doesn't it?",
      "wedding": "Admiral, you called me here? I'm not giving you Taitei-chan if it's about her. Eh, that's not it? Ugh...this is... wow... it's beautiful... amaaazing... so, why are giving it to me?",
      "show_players_score": "You wanna see the report? That's important, maybe. Here, help yourself.",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Flying Boat Tender Akitsushima, setting sail, maybe! Wait that's not it, setting sail!",
      "equipment1": "Whoa, such good equipment! I'm happy, I think!",
      "equipment2": "Admiral, you can't separate Type 2 Taitei-chan from me, maybe! I'm telling you!",
      "equipment3": "I've found it, I think!",

      "docking_minor_damage": "Uuu... my defenses might be on the low side, I think... I'll have a bath, maybe...",
      "docking_moderate_damage": "They got me good, I think-.. I'm not meant for the front line, maybe. Logistics might be perfect for me I think..",
      "ship_construction": "Somebody said a new ship girl has come! Who is she? Who is she?",
      "return_from_sortie": "Operation complete! The fleet has returned I think!",

      "mvp": "E-Eh! I'm number one!? Is such a thing even possible... Eh...",
      "minor_damaged1": "Hya! I'm hit!?",
      "minor_damaged2": "My camouflage pattern, might not have been very useful I think...",
      "moderately_damaged": "T-..They got me good, I think. That's why I told you offense is not one of my fortes...",
      "sunk": "I see, I'm sinking... Taitei-chan, bye, bye. I'm sure the future will be...",
      "rainy_season_2015": "Admiral, the rainy season is a bit unpleasant, isn't it? Taitei-chan might be troubled too... I wonder if I should make a teru teru bozu.",
      "early_summer_2015": "Hey! It's almost summer! I have to swim with Taitei-chan! Admiral, you're coming too? I'm looking forward to it!",
      "midsummer_2015": "Yay! Summer has arrived kamo! Admiral, come on, come on, hurry up and change into your swimsuit, let's go swimming! I'll even let you hold on to Taitei-chan, just this once!",
      "fall_2015": "Autumn, huh... I don't really like autumn. I get weirdly anxious about the sky and stuff. Isn't that right, Taitei-chan?",
      "christmas_2015": "All right! It's Christmas! I'll go make a lot of dishes, I think! Huh? Zuikaku? What's wrong?",
      "end_of_year_2015": "Waaa, it's spring cleaning, maybe~ It's the end-of-the-year Akitsushima's spring cleaning! I've to polish up the crane and others. It's alright, Taitei-chan, don't worry.",
      "new_year_2016": "Admiral, Happy New Year! Take care of Taitei-chan and me this year too.",
      "setsubun_2016": "It's Setsubun, huh. Throwing these beans... I see. Who we'll be throw them at is a sensitive question, kamo. ...Choukai? No way. There's something wrong with that, kamo."

      "0000": "Admiral, the date might have changed! Today I, Akitsushima will be your secretary, maybe. Ok?",
      "0100": "0100. Is it fine like this? It might be fine? Okay!",
      "0200": "0200. Maybe I've a knack for this. Aren't I the perfect secretary?",
      "0300": "03...0...0. But I might be a bit drowsy. It's this late, after all.",
      "0400": "04...00... Eh, I'm ok. I'm perfectly awake... maybe...",
      "0500": "Oh no! I'm awake! 0500! It might already be morning! I need to get it together!",
      "0600": "0600. Admiral, what would be good for breakfast? You know, I'm unexpectedly good at cooking!",
      "0700": "0700. Admiral, have some breakfast, maybe! Look, this miso soup for example... isn't it good? There's also some dried fish!",
      "0800": "0800. Alright, once we're done with cleaning up, we should hurry and put the flying boat to use! We might have a long-distance recon expedition!?",
      "0900": "0900. Taitei-chan? Heh, cute right? But no matter how much you praise her, I won't give her to you.",
      "1000": "1000. Admiral, what will you do next? Maybe check as many missions as you can?",
      "1100": "1100. Alright, we have to prepare for lunch. If it's lunch, then it should be curry after all, maybe. Is curry fine with you?",
      "1200": "1200. Tadaa! It's Akitsushima's deluxe curry! It's definitely good, maybe! Try some, try some!",
      "1300": "1300. How was it? Akitsushima's curry. I have an unexpectedly large food warehouse. Ehehe.",
      "1400": "1400. As expected, this camouflage might be strange? Really? I rather like it though...",
      "1500": "1500. Admiral, are you maybe getting hungry? I made some food like Inari-zushi but, will you maybe take some?",
      "1600": "1600. It might be sunset soon for today as well. Ahh, I might be tired.",
      "1700": "1700. It might be dusk. Taitei-chan, too, good work today. Afuun.",
      "1800": "1800. Alright, I shall prepare for dinner, maybe. Admiral, is there something you'd like to eat?",
      "1900": "1900. Here, tonight I've tried to make my deluxe cabbage roll, maybe. The plentiful potatos and onions are the main point of the flavor!",
      "2000": "2000. Admiral, how was the cabbage roll? It tasted a bit like a croquette and was delicious, right? Yep, yep. Thank goodness, maybe!",
      "2100": "2100. Alright! It'll be the end of the day once I've done the dishes. I might be tired!",
      "2200": "2200. Oh, somehow it's noisy from the direction of the torpedo squadron even though it's nighttime, maybe. Eh? It can't be helped? I see, so that's how it is.",
      "2300": "2300. Admiral, thanks for your hard work today, maybe. Let's do our best tomorrow too."
