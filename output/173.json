      "0300": "3 A.M. You will rise properly tomorrow, yes? Could you please be punctual in the morning?",
      "0400": "4 A.M. I shall take a short nap. All-nighters are bad for the skin.",

      "1000": "10 A.M. Kongou? Nagato? No, I don't know them. Who are they? Are they strong?",
      "1100": "It's 11 A.M... Yamato-class? That's got a strong feeling to it. I'd like to meet them.",
      "1200": "I am informing you that is it now 12 midday. Well now, what would be good for lunch?",
      "1300": "1 P.M. Oh, those destroyers of a familiar ship class are here. I know those kids.",
      "1400": "2 P.M. I wonder if Scharnhorst has also come here. I still would like to meet her.",
      "1500": "It's 3 P.M. I'd like to eat a little something sweet. Hey Admiral, did you hear me?",
      "1600": "4 P.M. Almost evening, no? Shall we leave it at this?",
      "1700": "5 P.M. Phew~, today was hard work as well. Well now, shall we stop at this checkpoint for today?",
      "1800": "6 P.M. Almost time for dinner. Admiral, what kind of menu do you have for me?",
      "1900": "It is 7 P.M. The Admiral's sauerkraut has an odd flavor... Oh, this is 'tsukemono', you say?",
      "2000": "8 P.M. It's really night now... It's bad for my skin, so could we not go on a night battle?",
      "2100": "9 P.M. H~mm, Japanese battleships have such tall bridges. Those sisters sure are something.",
      "2200": "It's 10 P.M. I shall take a rest soon.",
