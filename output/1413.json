I will protect them.",

      "secretarymarried": "Admiral, have you been eating well? If you don't eat and an emergency occurs, you may not survive it. Even surviving is a splendid battle in itself. So, let's go to Mamiya to eat.",
      "wedding": "Commander, what? This important discussion. Is it about the 17th Destroyer Division's formation? What, it's not? Then is it something about that Hamakaze? It has nothing to do with Hamakaze... I see. Nn... That ring... to me... w-what... eh! U-um...",

      "0200": "0200. It's night. What? Is there any dissatisfaction?",
      "0300": "0300. Gah... Commander, you're making such a difficult expression. Do you have something you want to say?",
      "0400": "0400. It is almost morning. I think I understand what is it that the Commander's so dissatisfied about, but...",

      "0800": "0800. Commander, what's wrong? You have a stomachache? That's no good, it'll hinder your commanding abilities.",
      "0900": "0900. Commander, did your stomachache go away? Aren't you lacking daily training?",
      "1000": "1000. Good, it is time for practice. The 17th Destroyer Division is ready to set sail anytime.",
      "1100": "1100. Leave the lunch to me as well. Tanikaze taught... Ah, why are you running away. Commander!",
      "1200": "1200. It's noon. Here are combat rations from Tanikaze. To have rice balls on the sea is something exceptional.",
      "1300": "1300. The rice balls were delicious, right? Even though Tanikaze might not like look like it, she's really adept at taking care of others.",
      "1400": "1400. Good, it is time for a real sortie. Let's dispatch our main fleet.",
      "1500": "1500. Afternoon snacks? No, no, I don't want it. I'll grow an excess bulge if I do.",
      "1600": "1600. Commander, let's strike the tough enemy fleet. Of course, we'll pick the line ahead formation. What, diamond formation you say? You don't understand. You don't understand!",

      "1900": "1900. I-it took quite sometime but dinner is ready. Commander, how is it?",
      "2000": "2000. That savory egg custard, too, is from Urakaze. Ah, that grilled fish is from me, Isokaze. Is it good?",
      "2100": "2100. Thank goodness for Urakaze... Cooking is hard.",
      "2200": "2200. So it's time. Good, it's time for night battle practice. 17th Destroyer Squadron, everyone gather all around!",
