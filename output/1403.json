      "introduction": "Light Cruiser Yahagi, reporting for duty. Let's work at it together to the end, Admiral!",
      "library_intro": "Yahagi, the third ship of the Agano-class light cruisers. I've participated in most of the major sea battles during the latter part of the war, including the Mariana Straits, Leyte Gulf, and Bonomisaki. That's right, I fought it out to the very end. I wonder what happened to Yamato, after my memories trailed off. Oh well... This time, I'm going to protect everything!",
      "secretary1": "Hmm, that's thoughtful. I don't mind that.",
      "secretary2": "So, what kind of plan are you making today?",
      "secretary3": "Haha, interesting. If you want to do thi~s, then maybe I'll do the same then, how about that?",
      "secretaryidle": "Right... If there can be another life for me after this one, I guess becoming something other than a warship wouldn't be such a bad idea.",
      "secretarymarried": "Admiralâ€¦ The fleet girls are complimenting you for your hard work, you know? ...he isn't listening...  Admiral, what the matter? You looked reddish. Taking care of yourself is important, you know. Hmm... You had slight fever. Right, I'll make you something nutritious. I'm off using Mamiya's kitchen for a while. Wait for me, okay?",
      "wedding": "Wha-, Admiral, you.. What's wrong? Your face... you have a rather serious expression. ...Eh, this is for me? Not for someone like Yamato or Yukikaze? For me!? W-what should I do... hu-hum.... What should I do..I-I...",
      "show_players_score": "There's a report for you, Admiral. How is it?",
      "joining_a_fleet": "Leave the 2nd Torpedo Squardon to me. This is Yahagi, raising anchor!",
      "equipment1": "Right, thanks.",
      "equipment2": "Okay... With this modification, we might be able to do this!",

      "minor_damaged1": "This is where I get serious!",
      "minor_damaged2": "Did you think I was going down with just a few hits?",
      "moderately_damaged": "If you want to sink me, you will need 5-6 torpedoes... otherwise, that won't do!",
      "sunk": "That's enough, get away from me... I can see Yamato and Yukikaze again... that's not so bad...",
      "christmas_2015": "It became a little cold.It's perfect for exercise. Tenth squadron setting off for exercising!",
      "end_of_year_2015": "What's the matter, Sakawa? Ah, you want to take that can up there? Here you go. Ah, you're spring cleaning. I'll help you.",

      "0300": "0300. Aren't you going half-watch ashore for the day? Hmm?",
      "0400": "0400. Hey, don't push yourself too much, okay? I can take care of the daily quests for you tomorrow.",
      "0500": "0500. It's the beginning of a brand new day at Kancolle!",
      "0600": "0600. Let's see, make equipment three times at the factory, and then go sortieing, and umm...",
      "0700": "0700. Okay, then construct three new ships, and... Urgh!",
      "0800": "0800. I'm exhausted. Daily quests aren't easy, are they Admiral... Oh, ehem.",
      "0900": "0900. Arms Reduction Treaty? Scrap two ships? ... I can't do that! ...I mean I will, but still...",
      "1000": "1000. Whew, I'm exhausted. Admiral, now I understand how difficult this is. I respect you a bit more now.",
      "1100": "1100. I think I'm better suited for seaborne combat. Let me head out there!",
      "1200": "1200. Doing things I'm not used to sure makes me hungry. So, what should we have for lunch?",
      "1300": "1300. They say this is popular in my hometown nowadays. A big round-meat sandwich... I guess?",
      "1400": "1400. Hm, hm, hm... that's pretty good! They call it a \"Hamburger\", apparently.",
      "1500": "1500. Now let's go sortieing again! Let's push on.",
      "1600": "1600. Oh, this? It's a sake cup with a Hagi flower and an arrow as a design. Nice, isn't it.",

      "2000": "2000. Well, it's time for night battles. How about it? Shall we go?",
      "2100": "2100. I'm still good to go, Admiral. I, Yahagi, will do my best!",
      "2200": "2200. Admiral, Yahagi Torpedo Squadron is going at it full strength! I'll crush those flag-BBs!",
      "2300": "2300. Ugh, battleships sure are tough... And enemy carriers... yes, I don't like them."
